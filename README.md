- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m arita, or whatever.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning for diagnostic medicine purposes, I also like to mess with devops tools, and have a small homelab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on assay development and robotic assistance; particularly the robotic assistance is done on machines by Tecan, Skalar, Bruker, and FOSS. I am also working on CI/CD integrations with Ansible.
