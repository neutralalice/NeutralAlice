- ðŸ‘— Hi, Iâ€™m arita, or whatever you want to call me.
- ðŸ§« Iâ€™m interested in machine learning for diagnostic medicine purposes. I also like to play with devops tools, and have a small homelab.
- ðŸŒ±  I currently working on CI/CD integrations with Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes. Trying to be able to stand up my whole homelab in ideally, less than 5 cli commands after loading the hypervisor
- ðŸ“« hit me up on twitter or mastodon.
